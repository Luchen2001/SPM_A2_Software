        VR1Family Charity Aid Services started off as a small not for profit
        organization, founded in June 2019 by a group3 of 5 volunteers in a
        garage in Mallacoota, Australia (thanks to the generous garage space
        that was given by the4 parents of a founding volunteer member). Their
        focus was to provide immediate humanitarian assistance and5 improve the
        lives of people facing economic, social, and health challenges in the
        immediate aftermath of natural6 calamities in their local community.
        Their common belief was that every person deserved a chance to thrive7
        irrespective of their personal circumstances. Hence, they wanted to
        identify communities and individuals facing8 the most pressing needs and
        provide them with the resources and support to overcome their
        challenges,9 especially in the aftermath of a natural disaster. Their
        first project was to collect aid and donations from10 community members
        and distribute it to people that were affected during the Australian
        Bushfires of 2019 – 11 2020. Their aid work was appreciated in the local
        news channels as well as the international media. Their 12 organization
        started getting expressions of interest from volunteers to participate
        and expand in their aid work in13 different parts of the world. The
        organization has also seen a steady stream of support from
        individuals,14 corporations, and governments in various forms such as
        receiving donation in the form of time (volunteer15 service), money,
        food / essential supply packages, and aid equipment.

        Since 2020, VR1Family slowly started16 expanding their footprint outside
        Australia, serving in multiple humanitarian aid assistance programs
        (such as17 Mount Sumeru volcanic eruption in Indonesia, flooding in
        Belgium and Germany, and the earthquake in18 Haiti). Whether it's
        providing food, clothing, and shelter to families in need, or supporting
        health initiatives to19 improve access to essential medical services,
        the organization was always committed to making a real and lasting20
        impact in the communities they served. Today, VR1Family is a global
        organization with their presence established21 in over 100 countries and
        served by a dedicated team of 15,000 volunteers. In addition to
        providing the standard22 survival kits in the event of a natural
        disaster (such as food, water and clothing), they have also expanded
        their23 operations to provide various types of humanitarian assistance
        packages such as wool and baby food, soap /24 textiles and toy packages,
        plow and farm tool packages (to facilitate self-help agricultural
        packages), medical25 supply packages and resettlement kits for refugees.
        VR1Family works to distribute aid directly to affected people,26 as well
        as work with partner aid agencies and government agencies to co.
        ordinate and support large scale aid27 distribution, based on the nature
        of the calamity.
